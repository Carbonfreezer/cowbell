Title: Performs Segmented Linear Regression with Two Independent Variables in Form of a Cowbell
Version: 0.1.0

Description: Implements a specific form of segmented linear regression with two independent variables. 
    The dependent variable reaches a maximum plateau once both independent once have reached a certain value.
    If one of them is below its specific value there is a linear increase in the dependent variable with the smaller 
    of the two independent ones. The visualization of that function looks like a quarter segment of a cowbell 
    giving the package its name. The package has been specifically constructed for the case where minimum 
    and maximum value of the dependent and two independent variables are known a priori, which is usually the case
    when those values are derived from Likert scales.
